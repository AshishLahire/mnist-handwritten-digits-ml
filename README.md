# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST dataset**. The goal is to compare different algorithms, analyze their performance, and visualize misclassified images to understand model behavior.

The project follows a complete **end-to-end ML pipeline**, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

## 🧠 Models Implemented
The following machine learning models are trained and evaluated:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression 


---

## 🔄 ML Pipeline
1. Load MNIST dataset
2. Data preprocessing and normalization
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Prediction and evaluation
6. Visualization of misclassified images
7. Performance comparison between models

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Misclassified image analysis

Misclassified input images and their predicted outputs are saved and visualized for better interpretability.
